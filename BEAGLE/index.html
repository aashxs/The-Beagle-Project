      <p>
        Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it
        is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and'thanks to its pleading
        expression'cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company
        and are generally easygoing. There are two Beagle varieties: those
        standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15
        inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as
        dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and
        white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with
        its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a
        broad head. A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers, Beagles are
        loving and lovable, happy, and companionable'all qualities that make
        them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been
        the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious,
        clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.
